## Problem Statement:

Develop a machine learning-based system utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify duplicate question pairs within a dataset sourced from Quora. The objective is to optimize the efficiency of question answering platforms by reducing redundancy and enhancing search accuracy through NLP-driven analysis. The system should proficiently classify question pairs as duplicates or non-duplicates by leveraging semantic similarity, syntactic structure, and contextual relevance. This approach aims to streamline content curation processes and improve user experience on the platform by facilitating the identification of high-quality content.

## Project Goal:

The project goal is to develop a machine learning-based system utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify duplicate question pairs within a dataset sourced from Quora. The primary objective is to enhance the efficiency of question answering platforms by reducing redundancy and improving search accuracy. By accurately classifying question pairs as duplicates or non-duplicates based on semantic similarity, syntactic structure, and contextual relevance, the project aims to streamline content curation processes and facilitate the identification of high-quality content. Ultimately, the goal is to improve the user experience on the platform by providing more relevant and diverse content while minimizing duplicate entries.
